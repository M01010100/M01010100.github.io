                            This project focuses on creating a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge that is both engaging and educational. The goal is to design a CTF that teaches participants about Computer science and Mathematical concepts while also providing a fun and competitive environment. The CTF will include a variety of challenges that cover topics such as cryptography, algorithms, and data structures. The challenges will be designed to be accessible to participants of all skill levels, from beginners to advanced users.

                        <h4>Quantum Computing</h4>
                        <p>
                            The primary challenge was understanding and implementing quantum algorithms within the context of the CTF challenges, what could be easily understood by participants. I choose to try and teach them fundementals through challenges, matrix algebra, basic gates, etc. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="method-section">
                        <h4>The Wheel</h4>
                        <p>
                            In order to make it interesting I choose to design system that based on its output would determine if the user would be granted a bonus or not. I used my knowledger from quant algorithms to design a circuit where it would choose random gates and apply them. 
                        </p>

                    <div class="method-section">
                        <h4>Cryptography</h4>
                        <p>
                            Upon completing the quantum challenges, I realized I may be the only person interested in quantum computing, so I added a cryptography section to the CTF. I added in more 'fun challenges' like make a real cipher used in ancient times, like a Scytale, an enigma machine decipherment, and lastly a Diffie-Hellman key exchange challenge.
