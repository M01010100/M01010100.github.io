        Why?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I procured this server orignally as a some what joke regarding my captone project. I had crashed three
        google collab session several time in earlier, non functioning versions of it. Since purchasing I began to run LLMs on it 
        in addition to virtualization and "Lab" enviroments.
