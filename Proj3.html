       <h1>AI based American Sign Language Interpreter</h1>
       <p>Gatehacks Fall(2024)</p>
       <br>
        <p>Our project is an AI based American Sign Language Interpreter. The project uses a camera to capture the sign language and then uses an API to return the response.
           This response is displayed on the screen along with the picure of the previous command. On the left side of the screen where the results are display, there is a session history.
           The history consisted of a small image of the sign,(photo taken by the camera) and the text of the command. This project was developed over a 24 hour period, along with a small pitch
           we gave to the judges.

        The Code for our project can be found at the following link: <a href="https://gatehacks2024-hackathon.vercel.app/">Vercel</a>
        The code does lack an API key, so it will not work without one, but the GUI can be seen.

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>Our project was developed using the following tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Node.js Framework</li>
            <li>React.js</li>
            <li>OpenAi API integration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The project was developed using the Node.js framework and React.js. The OpenAi API was integrated into the project to provide the AI functionality. 
        We conducted prompt engineering on the states so that when the picture is taken, only the tranlsation is returened and not further explanation or similar words.

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
        At some point in the future I do intend to build onto the backend of the project. Possibly implement a opensource model for the AI, or even build our own model which we decided was not possible in the time frame.
