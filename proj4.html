       <h1>Self Hosting a Hackathon</h1>
       <p>A Project & Challange based hackathon for students</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Preface</h2>
         <p>As a student, I have always wanted to host a hackathon. I have participated in a few hackathons and have always enjoyed the experience and noticed a gap in the market. There are not many Computer Science based hackathons in the Central New York Region
            There are competions hosted within schools but none that strive to be a collective body of students competing. Something similar to the CNY Hackathon. This is where I will denote that were I attend college in Utica-Rome area a Hackathon denotes a Cybersecurity competition.
            I learned that there was a CS rendition of the CNY but for reasons unkown in addition to the pandemic it has ceased to exist. I intend to reserect it in some form.
