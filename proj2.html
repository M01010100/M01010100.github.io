    <h1>Industrial Network Security</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <P> In this project I created a basic LED circuit and used <a href="https://autonomylogic.com/">openPLC</a> to control the circuit. Then connecting ther circuit to a Scadabr instance
        to monitor and remotely control the circuit. Following this I used NetCat to send a payload to remotely turn on and off the circuit. This was done through intercepting a command 
        and resending it by spoofing the sender IP to be that of the Scadabr server resulting in the openPLC running the command.
    </P>

    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <p> This project was conducted during one of my classes at MVCC, CI246 - Critical Infrastucture Security. This project took the forms of several labs throught the semester, that is the reason
        for the dates being spread over two months and format of the project. It was because of these labs I did a seperate project for another class on nmap, aftere looking in to other tools that 
        can be used for network searching/scanning.
