       <h1>Capstone: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Training</h1>
       <p>
        SUNY Polytechnic Institute Fall 2024.
        <br>
        In this project, I intended to learn about Machine Learning and ways to secure/ increase privacy to start my journey into my master's degree and the field. It leads me elsewhere,
        I went down the rabbit hole of Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation. I learned about the different types of encryption and how they can be used to secure data.
        To the point where I am more interested in Cryptography and the math behind it than Machine Learning itself. I have read papers, watched lectures and more on this subject.

        Constraints
        <br>
        For Capstone projects we select Limitations to keep the scope of this project contained, I will admit I had very loose constraints due to my topic. The constraints I did apply were 
        to use only python for the language and keep it related to Machine Learning. The final and over-arching constraint is to keep the paper at a Freshman reading level. So for my project this meant leaving out 
        any coversation on how the Math operates behind the blinds, I did metion the basics, algebriac structures and Polynomials.

       <section id="Methods">
        <h1>Library</h1>
        <P>For this project I used the TenSEAL library, a python wrapper for the SEAL library by Microsoft.</P><br>
        <h1>Model</h1>
        <p>For the model I used a simple Logistic Regression model to perform basic fraud detection.</p><br>
        <h1>Dataset</h1>
        <p>The dataset consisted of 6 features but with nearly 40,000 sets. This allowed for a good vartiation when shuffling.</p>
