       <h1>Capstone: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Training</h1>
       <p>
        SUNY Polytechnic Institute Fall 2024.
        <br>
        In this project, I intended to learn about Machine Learning and ways to secure/ increase privacy to start my journey into my master's degree and the field. It leads me elsewhere,
        I went down the rabbit hole of Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation. I learned about the different types of encryption and how they can be used to secure data.
        To the point where I am more interested in Cryptography and the math behind it than Machine Learning itself. I have read papers and written numerous notebooks, both physically and digitally (Juypter), on the subject.
