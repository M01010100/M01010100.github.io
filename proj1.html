                        <p>
                            In this project, I intended to learn about Machine Learning and ways to secure/increase privacy to start my journey into my master's degree and the field. It led me elsewhere‚ÄîI went down the rabbit hole of Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation. I learned about the different types of encryption and how they can be used to secure data, to the point where I am more interested in Cryptography and the math behind it than Machine Learning itself. I have read papers, watched lectures and more on this subject.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Constraints</h3>
                    <p>
                        For Capstone projects we select limitations to keep the scope of this project contained. I will admit I had very loose constraints due to my topic. The constraints I did apply were to use only Python for the language and keep it related to Machine Learning. The final and over-arching constraint is to keep the paper at a Freshman reading level. So for my project this meant leaving out any conversation on how the Math operates behind the blinds‚ÄîI did mention the basics: algebraic structures and Polynomials.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Problems</h3>
                    <p>
                        One major problem I encountered outside of the constraints was the nature of the project. As an NCS major I received little education on how the encryption algorithms and ciphers compute. We learned what they're used for and their rough implementation, but outside of this, nothing. So on top of implementing a research-level encryption scheme, I had no basis to start my understanding of cryptography. This I would overcome and continue learning after I finished my capstone. I ended up modifying some models I found, slowly combining and modifying them together to work with my data and gain the results I was looking for.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>
                        I achieved my desired result through trial and error, ending with better results on the encrypted data but at the cost of a drastic time increase. The prediction accuracy was higher on the encrypted data than the unencrypted data. The cost penalties do outweigh the results: from a couple seconds to around 5 minutes to complete, from one hundred megabytes to 2 gigabytes of RAM required to run their respective model, for a classical logistic regression model.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Changes I would Make</h3>
                    <p>
                        After completing this project there are some changes I would like to make or wish I knew of while hacking away: other and better FHE libraries and frameworks, such as <a href="https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe">TFHE</a> or <a href="https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml">Concrete ML</a> by Zama AI. Due to TENSeal being older and from Microsoft it had more material about it and being implemented, which is why I decided to use it. These newer libraries have modern features and easier implementations, such as working with sklearn models.
