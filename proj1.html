       <h1>Capstone: Privacy Preserving Machine Learning Training</h1>
       <p>
              SUNY Polytechnic Institute Fall 2024.
        This project which I inteded to learn about Machine Learning and ways to secure/ increase privacy to start my journey into my masters/field. It lead me elsewhere,
        I went down the rabbit hole of Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation. I learned about the different types of encryption and how they can be used to secure data.
        To the point of where I am more interested Cryptography, and the math behind it, then the Machine Learning itself. I have papers and wrote numerious notebooks, both physicaly and digital(Juypter), on the subject.
