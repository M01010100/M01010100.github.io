                            Ranked Choice Voting is a voting system that allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. This system is used in many countries around the world and in several US cities. The system is designed to ensure that the winning candidate has the broadest possible support among voters. In this project, we explore how Ranked Choice Voting works and how it can be implemented in various contexts.

                        <h4>Voting Process</h4>
                        <p>Ranked Choice Voting is a preferential voting system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference. Voters can rank as many candidates as they like, with their first choice being their top preference, their second choice being their second preference, and so on.</p>

                        <h4>Counting Rounds</h4>
                        <p>Once all votes are cast, they are counted in rounds. In each round, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on the voters' second choices. This process continues until one candidate receives a majority of the votes.</p>
